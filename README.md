Blokdude is a remake of the well known TI Caluculator game from Brandon Sterner as well as the blockman game from Soleau Software. 
This version of the game is based on the GP2X port of blockdude i made over a decade ago.

## Screenshots

## Game Features:
- 21 levels from original blockman game by Soleau Software + 4 levels made by me, in 2 level packs
- 5 skins to choose from (the Gamebuino META build only has the default skin)
- Audio can be switched on or off
- Free view mode to look around levels that are bigger than the screen
- Autosaves progress per level pack, options and the chosen skin

## Playing the Game:
The aim of the game, in any level, is to move the player to the exit door. You will need to create a path to this exit door by picking up blocks and placing them on strategic locations so you can reach the exit door.
The player will automatically jump on higher level blocks or ground if you keep moving left or right in front of them. 
If the level is bigger than what the screen can display, press R to enter free view, this will allow you to pan around the level using the dpad. Press B or R again to go back to the player.

After you solved a level the next level of that level pack is unlocked.

## Controls

On the Tufty 2350 a tap of HOME is B when it is let go, held HOME is a shift like BOOT on the Explorer.

On the Gamebuino META holding HOME for a second goes back to its loader.

## Devices
Every [release](https://github.com/joyrider3774/blockdude_embedded/releases) has a build for every device. `releases/` is where a build of your own puts them, it is not part of the repository:

The Tufty 2350 has no speaker, the game is silent there. Holding RESET until the rear LEDs are dark puts it to sleep, a front button wakes it up again, with UP and DOWN held as well it goes into shipping mode instead.

The Thumby Color's display is 128x128, the game's own size, so it is shown 1:1 over the whole screen. That build has not been tried on the device itself yet.

The Playdate shows the black & white skin, scaled up in the middle of its display. It has no side buttons, L and R are the restart and free view entries of its system menu.

The Game Boy Advance shows the game scaled to 160x160 in the middle of its screen, with black bars at the sides. Scrolling around a level that is bigger than the screen is slow there: the game engine draws the whole screen again while the view moves.

On the Nintendo DS the game is scaled to 192x192 in the middle of the top screen, with black bars at the sides, and the bottom screen stays dark. What the game saves goes into Blockdude.sav on the card it was started from, so a card that libfat can not write to (or an emulator without one) plays the game but forgets it afterwards. Its tones are square waves played as a sample: the DS's own tone channels count their frequency in a 16 bit timer and can not go below about 256 Hz.

On the Nintendo 3DS the game is scaled to 240x240 in the middle of the top screen, with black bars at the sides, and the bottom screen stays dark. What the game saves goes into sdmc:/3ds/Blockdude/Blockdude.sav. Its tones play through the console's DSP when the DSP firmware has been dumped to the SD card (sdmc:/3ds/dspfirm.cdc), and through CSND when it has not: on hardware either one plays, in an emulator only the DSP one does.

On MS-DOS the game runs in VGA mode X, 320x240 in 256 colours, blown up to 240x240 in the middle of the screen with black bars at the sides. That mode rather than the usual 320x200 one because its pixels are square, where 320x200 is stretched over the same screen and would show the game a fifth too tall. The 256 colours are set to the RGB332 cube, which is exactly what the game's 8 bpp screen buffer holds, so a frame reaches the card without a colour being worked out. Its tones are a square wave on the PC speaker, the progress is saved next to the program in BLOCKDUD.SAV, and Escape quits. The program is 32 bit and carries the CWSDPMI host inside it, so it needs nothing beside it on the disk.

In a browser the game is drawn into a canvas of its own 128x128 pixels, which the page stretches to whatever room it is given while keeping it square and keeping the pixels sharp. The progress is saved in the browser's localStorage under the game's name, so a private window plays it but forgets it afterwards. The zip holds index.html, index.js and index.wasm and is what an itch.io HTML project takes as it is.

On the Nintendo 64 the game is drawn into memory in the colours the RDP takes and the RDP shows it scaled to 240x240 in the middle of its 320x240 screen, with black bars at the sides. Its tones are a square wave written into the buffers the sound hardware plays from. The progress is saved in the cartridge EEPROM, which the ROM says it has, so a cartridge or an emulator without one plays the game but forgets it afterwards.

On the PlayStation the game is drawn into memory in the colours the GPU takes, handed to it as a texture and shown scaled to 240x240 in the middle of its 320x240 screen, with black bars at the sides. Its tones are a square wave the SPU plays from a single looping block. The memory card is not written yet, so what the game saves is gone when the console is switched off.

On the PlayStation Portable the game is doubled to 256x256 in the middle of the display, and the high scores are saved next to the EBOOT.PBP in Blockdude.sav.

On the PlayStation Vita the game is blown up four times to 512x512 in the middle of the display, and the high scores are saved in ux0:data/Blockdude/Blockdude.sav.

## Building
`python tools/build_releases.py` builds a release for every device  
`python tools/convert_skins.py` turns the images in `assets/skins` and `assets/skins2` into the headers the game includes  
`python tools/convert_levels.py` does the same for the levels in `assets/levels`

### Where the tools are
The script looks for everything in the place it is installed in here. A tool somewhere else is passed on the command line, or set as the environment variable in the last column and left off the command line:

| Option | What it points at | Default, or environment variable |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--arduino-cli PATH` | arduino-cli, which builds the Arduino devices | `ARDUINO_CLI` |
| `--arduino DIR` | the Arduino IDE 1.8 folder, used when there is no arduino-cli | `C:/arduino`, `ARDUINO_DIR` |
| `--lovyangfx DIR` | LovyanGFX for the Windows build, when it is not the one in the sketchbook | `LOVYANGFX_DIR` |
| `--msys2 DIR` | MSYS2's mingw64 bin folder, for cmake and ninja | `C:/msys64/mingw64/bin`, `MSYS2_BIN` |
| `--playdate-sdk DIR` | the Playdate SDK | `C:/playdate/PlaydateSDK`, `PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH` |
| `--playdate-arm DIR` | the bin folder of the ARM gcc the Playdate needs | `PLAYDATE_ARM_BIN` |
| `--libretro-common DIR` | libretro-common | `C:/github/libretro-common`, `LIBRETRO_COMMON_DIR` |
| `--devkitpro DIR` | devkitARM with libgba, libnds, calico, libctru and tools | `C:/devkitarm`, `DEVKITPRO` |
| `--psn00bsdk DIR` | PSn00bSDK | `C:/psn00bsdk`, `PSN00BSDK_PREFIX` |
| `--n64 DIR` | the mips64-elf toolchain with libdragon | `C:/n64_dev`, `N64_INST` |
| `--emsdk DIR` | the Emscripten SDK | `C:/github/emsdk`, `EMSDK` |
| `--dosdev DIR` | DJGPP with CWSDPMI | `C:/dos_dev`, `DOSDEV` |
| `--pspdev DIR` | the pspdev toolchain | `C:/psp_dev`, `PSPDEV_DIR` |
| `--vitasdk DIR` | VitaSDK | `C:/psvita_dev`, `VITASDK` |
| `--sdl2-mingw DIR` | SDL2's mingw package, its x86_64-w64-mingw32 folder | `SDL2_MINGW` |

Only the devices being built need their tool, so one missing toolchain does not stop the rest:

```
python tools/build_releases.py --only N64 DOS --n64 D:/n64_dev --dosdev D:/dos_dev
python tools/build_releases.py --list          shows what would be built
python tools/build_releases.py --only Web      one device only
```

### Build settings
Every device is built with its own settings. These change them for all of the devices at once, and `--list` shows what the defines would be without building anything. They are the same defines the device headers and the `platforms/*/CMakeLists.txt` files take, so a single device can be built with `-D<name>=<value>` from cmake instead:

| Option | What it sets | Values |
| ------ | ------------ | ------ |
| `--forceskin N` | `FORCESKIN`, the skin built in | `-1`, or `0` to `4` |
| `--forcescreenbuffer N` | `SCREENBUFFER`, where drawing goes | `0`, `1`, `8` or `16` bits per pixel |
| `--forcedebug` | `FORCEDEBUG 1`, the debug header is always shown | no value, on when it is given |

`-1` builds every skin in and lets the game's own options pick one. A number builds only that skin in, which is what a device short of room needs.

Not every device takes every buffer mode, `platforms/<device>/CMakeLists.txt` says which, and one it does not take stops that build with a message. A 1 bpp buffer can only show the one skin that is black and white, so it forces that skin whatever `--forceskin` says, see `FORCESKIN` in `defines.h`.

```
python tools/build_releases.py --forceskin 1                only skin 1, on every device
python tools/build_releases.py --only Windows --forcescreenbuffer 1
python tools/build_releases.py --list --forcedebug          what the defines would be
```

### Board packages and libraries
The Arduino devices are built with arduino-cli 1.5.1 and the versions below. They are the ones every release is built with, `.github/workflows/build-releases.yml` pins them:

| Device | Board package | Libraries |
| ------ | ------------- | --------- |
| ESPboy | esp8266:esp8266 3.1.2 | LovyanGFX 1.1.9, TFT_eSPI 2.4.72 |
| Gamebuino META | gamebuino:samd 1.2.2 | Gamebuino META 1.3.3 |
| Adafruit PyBadge, PyGamer | adafruit:samd 1.7.16 | Adafruit GFX Library 1.12.6, Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library 1.5.15, Adafruit BusIO 1.17.4, Adafruit NeoPixel 1.15.5, Adafruit SPIFlash 5.1.1 |
| PicoSystem, Explorer, Tufty 2350, Thumby Color | rp2040:rp2040 5.5.0 | none, everything they use comes with the core |

The ESPboy draws through LovyanGFX and only includes TFT_eSPI's header, so the exact TFT_eSPI does not matter much.  
The Gamebuino's core needs Arduino's own arduino:samd 1.8.14 beside it for sam.h, without it the build stops at "sam.h: No such file or directory".  
The Windows build draws through the same LovyanGFX 1.1.9, see `platforms/windows/CMakeLists.txt`.

### Toolchains
The Playdate build also needs the Playdate SDK, see `platforms/playdate/CMakeLists.txt`  
The libretro core needs libretro-common, see `platforms/libretro/CMakeLists.txt`  
The Game Boy Advance build needs devkitARM and libgba, see `platforms/gba/CMakeLists.txt`  
The Nintendo DS build needs devkitARM, libnds and calico, see `platforms/nds/CMakeLists.txt`  
The Nintendo 3DS build needs devkitARM and libctru, see `platforms/3ds/CMakeLists.txt`  
The PlayStation build needs PSn00bSDK, see `platforms/psx/CMakeLists.txt`  
The Nintendo 64 build needs the mips64-elf toolchain and libdragon, see `platforms/n64/CMakeLists.txt`  
The PSP build needs the pspdev toolchain, see `platforms/psp/CMakeLists.txt` (pspdev has no Windows build, so on Windows it is built from WSL)  
The Vita build needs VitaSDK, see `platforms/vita/CMakeLists.txt`  
The browser build needs Emscripten, see `platforms/web/CMakeLists.txt`  
The MS-DOS build needs DJGPP, see `platforms/dos/CMakeLists.txt`


## Credits
The Blockdude game idea was created by Soleau Software for the dos blockman game and Brandon Sterner for the Ti Calculator based game. I don't know who invented the idea first.

The Game uses 21 levels from the Soleau Software blockman dos game. At The time i had created the gp2x version i had gotten approval to use these levels

The game has 5 skins using tilesets created by different people / games
- Default Skin: Based on a Remake of the flatskin made for the gp2x version by Fusion Power
- Tech Skin: Based on a skin made for the gp2x version by fusion power
- Ti Skin: Based on the assets from the Ti calculator game by brandon Sterner 
- Kenney skin: Based on the 1 bit platformer pack https://kenney-assets.itch.io/1-bit-platformer-pack - https://www.kenney.nl
- Flat Skin: Based on the flash game created by Klas Kroon and Kris Katiesen, i had gotten permission at the time of creating the gp2x version to use these assets
